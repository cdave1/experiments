Both depth-first search and breadth-first search can be tested with prebuilt
graphs in "SearchTest.hs". Just compile and execute SearchTest.hs for this.
Alternatively, from the same directory as "SearchTest.hs", fire up ghci and
type the following:
Prelude> :add SearchTest.hs
*Main> main

To use breadth first search and depth first search directly in a haskell 
script, import BFS and/or DFS, define a set of functions the describe a 
graph and call dfsearch or bfsearch depending on what traversal sequence 
you want. The signatures of both functions are:
   bfsearch :: (Eq a) => (a -> [a]) -> a -> (Queue a)
   dfsearch :: (Eq a) => (a -> [a]) -> a -> (Stack a)
