I'm learning how an LLM works from first principles (i.e. no libraries, don't use pytorch etc).

Claude helped with a lot of this.

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install PyTorch:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

To deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
